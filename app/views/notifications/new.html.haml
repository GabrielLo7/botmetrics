            With notifications you can send product announcements / maintenance window announcments and so on
            to your users. Notifications will only be sent to users
            %strong
              who have interacted with your bot at least once.

            You can also schedule your notification to be sent at a specific time. For e.g. if you schedule your message to be sent at
            = _time.strftime("%B %d, %Y 9:00AM")
            , the notification will be sent
            %strong
              at 9AM in each user's timezone
            on
            = _time.strftime("%B %e")
      = render 'form', bot: @bot, notification: @notification
